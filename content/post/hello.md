"There were open source projects and free software before Linux was there. Linux in many ways is one of the more visible and one of the bigger technical projects in this area, *and it changed how people looked at it because Linux took both the practical and ideological approach."* - Linus Torvalds

> "Software is like sex: it's better when it's free." - Linus Torvalds

The theory behind open source is simple. In the case of an operating system, the source code-the programming instructions underlying the system-is free. Anyone can improve it, change it, exploit it. But those improvements, changes, and exploitations have to be made freely available. Think Zen. The project belongs to no one and to everyone. When a project is opened up, there is rapid and continual improvement. With teams of contributors working in parallel, the results can happen far more speedily and successÂ­ fully than if the work were being conducted behind closed doors. - Linus Torvalds

- In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved.
- Fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things.
- Any program is only as good as it is useful.
- My name is Linus, and I am your God.
