I am a hobbyist programmer and an aspiring game developer. I'm here to pass on my knowledge to everyone I can, and when I learn something new I'll pass that on too.

I fell feel the same way about knowledge and skills, especially when it comes to technology. Thank you, Linus Torvalds, for that quote. With that said, I'll be making helpful videos and posting them on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbux7yV6fVJS-JK-dBlnEOw) so anyone can have access to it. If you want to hang-out with me and/or just what to watch me play games, I also stream on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/harakaza) I look forword to what the future brings you all.

- Sincerely, Hara Kaza
